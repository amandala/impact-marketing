              The CanSO Foundation exists to provide access to sports
              opportunities for people of all ages, income levels, and
              abilities. They believe in creating healthy opportunities for
              everyone in our communities. Whether it means helping members of a
              low income family register to take part in the sport of their
              choice, working with seniors organizations to limit social
              isolation by providing healthy activities, or helping a promising
              athlete reach their full potential, we know that strong
              communities start with healthy, active members.
