## Getting Started

Quick Links:
[NextJS](https://nextjs.org/)
[create-next-app](https://create-next-app.github.io/)

This was bootstrapped using create-next-app and uses NextJS to deliver server rendered HTML and CSS generated by React.

It's hosted on Heroku. Automatic deployments are created every time we push to or merge a pull request into `development` and `master` branches.

The staging app can be found at [https://impact-mktg-stage.herokuapp.com/](https://impact-mktg-stage.herokuapp.com/)

Email dev@portad.ca to request access to the Heroku dashboard and Github repo.

Clone the repo to your local development machine.

Run `yarn` to install dependencies

Run `yarn dev` to start the NextJS server on [http://localhost:3000](localhost:3000)

## Contribution Guidelines

**Do not** push directly to the `development` or `master` branches.

1. Make an issue in GitHub and take note of the issue number.
2. Create a new branch off of `development` following the naming convention `feature/[issue number]` or `bugfix/[issue number]`.
3. Write some awesome code and push it to your branch.
4. Create a pull request into the `development` branch and request a review from amandala :)
