            <P>
              IMPACT Festival was created by Dusk2Dawn Productions and Party
              Well in 2019. The goal was to create a unique festival expirience
              that focused on giving back. By gathering likeminded people to
              celebrate the gift of life. IMPACT was able to spark some amazing
              creativity and imagination.
            </P>
            <P>
