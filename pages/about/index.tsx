            <P>
              IMPACT Festival was created by Dusk2Dawn Productions and Party
              Well in 2019. The goal was to create a unique festival expirience
              that focused on giving back. By gathering likeminded people to
              celebrate the gift of life. IMPACT was able to spark some amazing
              creativity and imagination.
            </P>
            <P>

              Out there somewhere in the deeps of space, on a world eerily
              similar to our own, an intelligent species of biped revelled in
              their prosperity, developing wonderous scientific advances and
              economic prosperity. But... with the spoils of technology, came a
              blissful ignorance towards the natural life and overall harmony on
              the planet.
            </P>
            <P>
              With the increase in toxic emissions slowly consuming the planet
              this world soon reached a crisis point, causing a dramatic shift
              in the climate and bringing about widespread devastation. Rising
              seas soon claimed cities, natural disasters claimed entire
              continents and their civilization fell apart. THE FEW WHO REMAINED
              NEARLY LOST ALL HOPE.
            </P>
            <P>
              The bipeds gathered their finest minds and launched a ship out
              into space with the mission of sharing the STORY of their failed
              world, preserving their culture and HOPING ANOTHER SPECIES WOULD
              PAY HEED TO THE LESSON. Their story is a sad one... but.... we
              have come to your planet because we have hope for ALL OF YOU, THE
              IMPACT COMMUNITY.
